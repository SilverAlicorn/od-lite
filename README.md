# Welcome!

**Orbital Dawn Lite** is a companion game to Orbital Dawn. It is a "rapid prototyping" test bed, where game mechanics and new features are debuted. It is a console-based (ncurses) game, intended to be run over low bandwidth connections. It should be compatible with Windows, Linux and NetBSD; MacOS compatibility is likely but cannot be tested at this time.

More to come!
