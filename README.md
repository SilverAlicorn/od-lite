# Welcome!

**Orbital Dawn Lite** is a companion game to Orbital Dawn. It is a "rapid prototyping" test bed, where game mechanics and new features are debuted. It is a console-based (ncurses) game, intended to be run over low bandwidth connections. It should be compatible with Windows, Linux and NetBSD; MacOS compatibility is likely but cannot be tested at this time.

# Early Access Out Now!

I've uploaded the work I've done so far. It's not much and I don't guarantee it will work! But you can at least look at my code and laugh at how awful it is. I actually haven't touched this in a long time and I forget what I was doing. Apparently you need both station.json and craft.json for it to run.
